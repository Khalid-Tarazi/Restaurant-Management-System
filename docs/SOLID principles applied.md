### Regarding the SOLID principles:

**1.	Single responsibility principle:**

¤	Each class has a single responsibility. For example, Table class manages information related to a table, Menu class handles operations related to the menu, and so on.

¤	Payment interface and its implementations (CreditCardPayment and CashPayment) are responsible for handling different types of payment methods.

**2.	Open/Closed principle:**

¤	The classes are designed in a way that allows for extension without modification. For instance, new types of payments can be introduced without altering existing payment processing code by implementing the Payment interface.

**3.	Liskov substitution principle:**

¤	Subclasses like CreditCardPayment and CashPayment are substitutable for their base class (Payment interface) without affecting the functionality.

**4.	Interface segregation principle:**

¤	The Payment interface provides a clear and minimal set of methods that are relevant to all payment types, making sure that implementing classes only need to implement what is required for their specific payment method.

**5.	Dependency inversion principle:**

¤	High-level modules (RMS, Manager) depend on (Payment, Report, Staff) rather than concrete implementations, promoting flexibility and ease of modification.
